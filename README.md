# Event Scheduler

This project was for the data structure course.

The project was about making an event scheduler application that has some constraints when adding an event like you can't add an event in the same time as another event.

The events are read and written in a file so all the events added are not deleted when the app is closed.

### In this project, the user can:

1- Add a new event.

2- Update an Exciting event.

3- Display the existing events.    

4- Display the existing events ordered by their importance.

5- Display the past events.               

6- Delete an existing event.

7- Search for an existing event.
